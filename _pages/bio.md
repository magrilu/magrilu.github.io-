I received the Laurea (M.S.) degree in Mathematics from the University of Milan (IT) in 2011. <br>
After a stage with [Lilli][lilli] & [Bea][bea] in the Applied Math Group of AST labs of [St Microelectronics][st] in Agrate (MB, IT), in 2012 I started my PhD in Applied Mathematics and Statistic for Computation Science at the University of Milan.  I worked under the supervision of [Andrea Fusiello][andrea] and in 2015, I received the PhD  with a thesis on robust multiple model fitting for Computer Vision applications.

From 2015 to 2018, I have been a post-doc researcher first at the University of Verona (Dept. of Computer Science) and then at the University of Udine (DPIA). In these periods I collaborated with [3DFlow srl][3dflow] on 3D reconstruction themes (photometric stereo, bundle adjustment and automatic indoor floor plan acquisition).

In 2018-2019 I joined the R&D group of [FARO Technologies][faro] (Rezzato, IT) where I worked as a 3D software Engineer on acquisition and registration techniques for structured light scanner.

Now I am at Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria of the Politecnico di Milano (DEIB) as a post-doc researcher with [Giacomo Boracchi][giacomo].

I'm involved in activities for the popularization of mathematics, give a look at [dramath][dramath] if you are interested. <br>
In my leisure time I enjoy drawing and playing basketball, albeit with questionable results. 
<!--And I'm a great connoisseur of "tortelli", a typical Milanese carnival food.-->
